## Preamble
A mysterious horde of asteroids had been released upon Earth and unleashed terror among its inhabitants. You, an awarded space commander, had been chosen to protect Earth by destroying all the asteroids before they hit the planet!

*Play [here](https://devtony101.github.io/gasteroids/)*.

## Game mechanics
- **Your misssion**: Destroy as many asteroids as you can! If an asteroid goes past the bottom border of your screen you will lose a heart point! The number of heart points you start the game with are conditioned by the game's difficulty.
- **Moving**: You can move your ship by moving the mouse along the x-axis.
- **Shooting**: You can activate your laser gun by clicking on the screen or pressing the space bar. The number of "bullets" you can fire at a given time is conditioned by the game's difficulty.
- **Bonus mode**: Some asteroids are ***Bonus Asteroids***, when you manage to destroy one it will grant you additional bullets per shoot. You'll only have this upgrade for 10 seconds after destroying the bonus asteroid. Bonus asteroids, unlike regular asteroids, will be colored. The number of extra bullets depends on the game difficulty, check the table below for reference.
- **Exiting the game**: You can press the **[ESC]** key at any time to exit the game.

## Game modes
There's three game modes you can play: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**. Each game mode changes certain aspects of the game, specifically:

- The number of lives you start the game with
- The number of lasers you can fire at a given time
- The number of asteroids the game starts with
- The number of asteroids that spawn each 50 frames of animation
- The score multiplier

The way these values are set in each game mode are given in the table below:
| Game mode | # of initial lives | # of bullets that can be fired at once | # of initial asteroids | # of generated asteroids | Score multiplier | # of additional bullets per bonus round |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Easy      | 5                  | 5                                      | 2                      | 1                        | 1                | 1                                       |
| Medium    | 5                  | 7                                      | 3                      | 2                        | 1.2              | 2                                       |
| Hard      | 8                  | 9                                      | 5                      | 3                        | 1.5              | 4                                       |

You can pick one of these modes at the "**Game Over**" screen.

## Improvements
If you are interested, here's some items you could make to improve this game. Remember to follow the [contributing guide](https://github.com/DevTony101/gasteroids/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

- [ ] Make the spaceship explode when an asteroid hit it
- [ ] Give the spaceship some special super-power based on the score
- [ ] Give the spaceship an extra-live based on the score
- [X] Give the spaceship some powerup by exploding an "special item" ([v1.3.0](https://github.com/DevTony101/gasteroids/releases/tag/v1.3.0))
- [ ] Add a bossfight (A big asteroid that requires a set number of hits maybe?)
